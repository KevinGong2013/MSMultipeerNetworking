##### What is it? #####

[MSMultipeerNetworking](https://github.com/mstultz/MSMultipeerNetworking "MSMultipeerNetworking") is a library that establishes a client-server network model built upon Apple's [Multipeer Connectivity](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/MultipeerConnectivity/Reference/MultipeerConnectivityFramework/index.html) and Apache's [Thrift](https://github.com/apache/thrift "Thrift") frameworks. Using Multipeer Connectivity, iOS devices can connect local peers using Wi-Fi networks, peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth personal area networks. Peers can take on the role of a server and service clients through remote procedure calls via Thrift, providing an authoritative centralization of data and functionality. Thrift allows developers to establish client-server interoperability by generating code through a simple [Interface Definition Language](http://thrift.apache.org/docs/idl "Interface Definition Language").
