### MultipeerClientServer ###

##### What is it? #####

[MultipeerClientServer](https://github.com/mstultz/MultipeerClientServer "MultipeerClientServer") is a set of code that establishes a client-server network model built upon Apple's [Multipeer Connectivity](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/MultipeerConnectivity/Reference/MultipeerConnectivityFramework/Introduction/Introduction.html "MultipeerConnectivity") framework. Using Multipeer Connectivity, iOS devices can connect local peers using Wi-Fi networks, peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth personal area networks. With MultipeerClientServer, a peer can take on the role of a server and service clients through remote procedure calls. Servers provide an authorative, centralization of data and functionality.
